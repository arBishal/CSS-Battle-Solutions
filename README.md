# CSS Battle Solutions

This repository stores my CSSBattle solutions â€” small HTML/CSS files that recreate shapes and art to solve challenges from [CSS Battle](https://cssbattle.dev).

## Purpose
- Keep a personal collection of solutions for reference and learning.
- Track different approaches and improvements over time.
- Share solutions with others who want to learn from them.

## Repository structure
- `battles/` - contains each battle in its own folder.
  - `Battle-<Number>-<Battle-Name>/` - folders for each challenge. Example: `Battle-37-Height/`.
    - Solution files are named with the challenge id and title, e.g. `243-corn.html`.

## How to view a solution
Open the HTML file directly in your browser. On Windows, you can right-click and choose "Open with..." or drag the file into a browser window.

Example:
- `battles/Battle-37-Height/243-Corn.html`

## Naming conventions
- Files use the format `<Challenge-Id>-<Short-Title>.html` to keep things consistent and searchable.
- Use lowercase and hyphens for titles.

## Future ideas
- Add an `index.html` or script that generates a gallery of all solutions.
- Add per-battle READMEs that explain the approach and CSS techniques used.
